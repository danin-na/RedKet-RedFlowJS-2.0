You can achieve the same result as your `Icon_01` class in several ways using modern JavaScript, moving away from the traditional class-based approach. Here are the most common and effective alternatives, along with explanations and trade-offs:

**1.  A Single Function (Most Straightforward)**

Since your class has only one main method (`work`), the simplest and most direct alternative is a single function. This is often the best choice when you don't need to manage internal state or have multiple related methods.

```javascript
function setIconContent(config) {
    const tagSelector = config.rf.worker.tag.icon;
    const sourceAttribute = config.rf.worker.opt.source;

    document.querySelectorAll(`[${tagSelector}]`).forEach((element) => {
        element.innerHTML = decodeURIComponent(element.getAttribute(sourceAttribute));
    });
}

// Usage (assuming you have a 'config' object similar to the class constructor):
// setIconContent(myConfig);
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Directness:** This function directly performs the core logic of your class's `work` method.
*   **No `this` context:**  We avoid the `this` keyword, making the code easier to reason about and less prone to context-related bugs.  We directly access the configuration values.
*   **Readability:** The code is very concise and easy to understand.
*    **No Instance:** Because this is only one function, this doesn't create an instance

**2. Module Pattern (with a Configuration Function)**

If you want to encapsulate the configuration and provide a slightly more structured approach (though arguably unnecessary for this specific case), you could use a module pattern. This encapsulates the configuration and the `work` function (renamed here for clarity).  This is beneficial if you *might* add more related functions in the future.

```javascript
const iconModule = (function() {
    let tagSelector;
    let sourceAttribute;

    function configure(config) {
        tagSelector = config.rf.worker.tag.icon;
        sourceAttribute = config.rf.worker.opt.source;
    }

    function updateIcons() {
        document.querySelectorAll(`[${tagSelector}]`).forEach((element) => {
            element.innerHTML = decodeURIComponent(element.getAttribute(sourceAttribute));
        });
    }

    return {
        configure,
        updateIcons
    };
})();

// Usage:
// iconModule.configure(myConfig);
// iconModule.updateIcons();
```

**Explanation:**

*   **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):**  The `(function() { ... })();` creates a self-contained scope.  This is the essence of the module pattern.
*   **Private Variables:**  `tagSelector` and `sourceAttribute` are now "private" to the module (accessible only within the IIFE).
*   **`configure` function:**  This sets up the internal configuration.  This is important because it separates the setup from the actual execution.
*   **`updateIcons` function:** This performs the core logic, using the configured variables.
*   **Returned Object:**  The IIFE returns an object with the `configure` and `updateIcons` functions, making them accessible from outside.  This creates a well-defined public API.

**3. Functional Approach with Closures (Most Flexible)**

This approach combines the directness of a single function with some of the encapsulation benefits of the module pattern. It's particularly useful if you need to create multiple "icon updaters" with different configurations.

```javascript
function createIconUpdater(config) {
    const tagSelector = config.rf.worker.tag.icon;
    const sourceAttribute = config.rf.worker.opt.source;

    return function updateIcons() {
        document.querySelectorAll(`[${tagSelector}]`).forEach((element) => {
            element.innerHTML = decodeURIComponent(element.getAttribute(sourceAttribute));
        });
    };
}

// Usage:
// const myIconUpdater = createIconUpdater(myConfig);
// myIconUpdater(); // Call the returned function to update the icons

// You can create multiple updaters with different configurations:
// const anotherIconUpdater = createIconUpdater(anotherConfig);
// anotherIconUpdater();
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`createIconUpdater` Function:** This function *returns another function*. This is the key to closures.
*   **Closure:** The inner `updateIcons` function "closes over" the `tagSelector` and `sourceAttribute` variables.  This means that even after `createIconUpdater` has finished executing, `updateIcons` still has access to those variables.
*   **Multiple Instances (Conceptually):** Each time you call `createIconUpdater`, you get a *new* `updateIcons` function, with its own set of captured configuration variables. This effectively simulates having multiple instances of a class, but without the class syntax.
*   **Flexibility:** This is the most flexible approach. It allows you to easily create specialized icon updaters without modifying shared state.

**4. Web Components (If you are building reusable UI elements)**
If the icon is a part of a reusable UI component, consider using web components which provide better encapsulation, and reusability.

```javascript
class MyIcon extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
  }

  connectedCallback() {
    const source = this.getAttribute('data-source'); // Assuming a data-source attribute
    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = decodeURIComponent(source);
  }
}

customElements.define('my-icon', MyIcon);

//Usage in HTML
//<my-icon data-source="%3Csvg%3E...%3C%2Fsvg%3E"></my-icon>
```
**Explanation**
*   **Encapsulation:** Styles and markup are scoped to the component.
*   **Reusability:** You can reuse `<my-icon>` across your project.
*   **Custom Element:**  You define a new HTML tag (`my-icon` in this case).
*   **Shadow DOM:**  The `attachShadow({ mode: 'open' })` creates a Shadow DOM, isolating the component's internal structure and styles from the rest of the page. This is crucial for preventing style conflicts and maintaining encapsulation.
*   **`connectedCallback`:** This lifecycle method is called when the component is added to the DOM.  This is where we perform the icon update.
*   **`data-source` Attribute:** The example assumes you'll pass the encoded SVG data through a `data-source` attribute on the custom element.  This is a common and clean way to provide data to web components.
* **Registration:** `customElements.define('my-icon', MyIcon);` registers your component to the browser.

**Which approach to choose?**

*   **Simplest Case (Option 1):** If you just need to perform the icon update operation once and your configuration is straightforward, a single function is the best choice.
*   **Slightly More Structure (Option 2):** If you anticipate needing to add more related functionality *and* you want to keep the configuration separate, the module pattern might be a good fit.  It's a bit more overhead than a single function, but offers better organization.
*   **Flexibility and Multiple Configurations (Option 3):** If you need to create multiple "icon updaters" with different configurations, the functional approach with closures is the most powerful and flexible.
* **Reusable and Encapsulated UI (Option 4):** Web components are the ideal solution for reusable UI elements.
In your *specific* case, given the simplicity of the `Icon_01` class, the **single function (Option 1)** or the **functional approach with closures (Option 3)** are likely the best choices. Option 3 gives you more flexibility for future expansion. Option 4 (Web Components) would be overkill unless you're specifically building a reusable, encapsulated icon component.  Option 2 is a reasonable middle ground, but might be unnecessary complexity for this particular task.
